# Challenge
This was presented by an e-commerce site as a kind of online whiteboard problem during a technical interview:

> Given an array of numbers and a sum value. Find the first two numbers in the array that add to the sum value. ([3, 5, 9, 6, 12, 15]; 18)

A pretty simple question and the interviewer tried to be helpful (correct answer is 6 and 12).

## Failure
I just really choked. I felt bad for wasting their time (there were four of us in the interview).

In coding the solution, I find it's actually a bit trickier than it looks.
