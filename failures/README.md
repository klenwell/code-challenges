# Failures
This directory documents the code challenges that I have failed. Usually pretty abjectly.

Here I try to salvage a little of my honor and discover some solace if not exactly redemption.

## Array Sum
This was presented by an e-commerce site as a kind of online whiteboard problem during a technical interview:

> Given an array of numbers and a sum value. Find the first two numbers in the array that add to the sum value. ([3, 5, 9, 6, 12, 15]; 18)

A pretty simple question and they tried to be helpful (correct answer is 6, 12). I just really flopped on it. I felt bad for wasting their time (there were four of us in the interview).

In actually coding the solution, I find it's actually a bit trickier than it looks. I imagine there are ways they could have screened me more effectively. Perhaps making a timed coding challenge the first step after application.
