# Challenge
This was presented by a well-known federal government digital agency in the United States as a kind of online whiteboard problem during a technical interview:

> runlength_encode("aabbbcaa") should return "2a3b1c2a"

The exercise was done in a pastebin environment where the code could not be executed.

## Failure
I originally neglected to capture the final item in the loop, even after the interviewer asked about it. I caught it after the interview when I executed it and emailed a correction to the interviewer.

Otherwise, I came up with my solution swiftly and the interviewer remarked that she hadn't seen this approach before. A compliment? There are probably slightly more efficient implementations but I like the readability of my approach.

Was I rejected because I missed the last iteration? I don't think so but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
