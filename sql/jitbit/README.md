# Jitbit SQL Interview Test
I had bookmarked this challenge a few years back:

- https://www.jitbit.com/news/181-jitbits-sql-interview-questions/

I happened to stumble across it recently. Since I'm looking for a job, I figured now would be a good time to give it a whirl.

I've teed up a DB Fiddle for the challenge on Postgres 12 here:

## Challenge
From the Jitbit article:

>We give our candidates this simple database schema and ask the following questions:
>
>- Select employees (names) who have a bigger salary than their boss
>- Select employees who have the biggest salary in their departments
>- Select departments that have less than 3 people in it
>- Select all departments along with the number of people there (tricky - people often do an "inner join" leaving out empty departments)
>- Select employees that don't have a boss in the same department
>- Select all departments along with the total salary there
>
>Like I said, it's pretty basic. And there's more than one correct solution for each of these questions.
>
>Feel free to use it in your interviews. And if you do, a link back would be much appreciated ;)
