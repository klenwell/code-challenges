## Overview
This was a puzzle I randomly came across on the internet one day. Here to be exact:

I used to bring it to me to interviews as a backup coding challenge question. The
idea was that if I was presented with a problem I had no idea how to solve, I would
offer this one as an alternative. The old [topsy-turvy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fFgBaBqnNk).

I haven't actually done this yet. I did miss a great opportunity recently.


## Challenge
My version of challenge:

Two people, Alice and Bob, are each flipping a coin repeatedly. Alice will stop
when she flips two heads in a row (HH). Bob will stop when he flips a head followed
immediately by a tail (HT).

Who will flip the coin more times on average: Alice, Bob, or is there no difference?


## Notes
- From Metafilter link: *This was demonstrated to me in grad school when my advisor, addressing a roomful of mathematicians, posed this problem... He let everyone think for a moment, then took a show of hands. Almost everyone got it wrong.*
- My solution uses a simple brute force simulation. I find this most persuasive.
